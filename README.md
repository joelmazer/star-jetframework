this will be updated... also see: https://github.com/joelmazer/star-jetframework/blob/master/UPDATES.md

This is a framework for:

a FastJet wrapper, with various functionality
jet-finding
underlying event rho calculation, for both 'normal' and very 'sparse' events
QA of jets, towers, events, tracks, triggers
code for generating dead and bad tower lists
creating reduced track objects (FemtoTracks)
event mixing (for acceptance and detector effects via event pool manager)
a base class used for inheritance
studying jet shapes
calculating the event plane using multiple detectors + all included corrections
jet-hadron corrrelations
dummy analysis class to get started
Additionally contained are multiple other classes useful for the main correlation analysis

Getting started
Prerequisites / also needed
inside your StRoot directory, you will need to copy the contents of this git repository into the directory

StMyAnalysisMaker/
For centrality, you will need the repository:

https://github.com/joelmazer/Centrality
In particular, you will need the StRefMultCorr directory in the Centrality repository to be placed into your StRoot directory. This leads to the following StRoot structure:

StRoot/StMyAnalysisMaker/
StRoot/StRefMultCorr/
Installing
FASTJET install
This framework requires the installation of FastJet + FastJet contrib. FastJet can be found at http://fastjet.fr/all-releases.html

download FastJet 3.0 +
FastJet contrib can be found at:

http://fastjet.hepforge.org/contrib/
RCAS & PDSF both require 32-bit build to fit into another software framework. To force this install on the 64-bit systems, please follow the below prescription to avoid headaches.

FASTJET installation example:

  tar zxvf fastjet-3.2.2.tar.gz
  cd fastjet-3.2.2/
  ./configure --prefix=$PWD/../fastjet-install CXXFLAGS="-m32 -fPIC -fno-inline" CFLAGS="-m32 -fPIC -fno-inline" LDFLAGS="-m32"

  make
  make check
  make install
FastJet contrib installation example:

  tar zxvf fjcontrib-1.026.tar.gz
  cd fjcontrib-1.026
  ./configure --fastjet-config=$PWD/../fastjet-3.2.2/fastjet-config --prefix=$PWD/../fastjet-install CXXFLAGS="-m32 -fPIC -fno-inline" CFLAGS="-m32 -fPIC -fno-inline" LDFLAGS="-m32"

  make
  make install
  make fragile-shared
  make fragile-shared-install
unset flags after:

  unset CXXFLAGS CFLAGS LDFLAGS
You will additionally need to set FastJet environmental variables in your startup file (mine is .bashrc, and the below is an example):

export FASTJET='/path/to/your/FastJet/fastjet-install'
export FASTJET_CONTRIB='/path/to/your/FastJet/fjcontrib-1.026'
and soft link the include paths to your working directory which contains your StRoot directory and where you run your readPicoDst.C file from:

ln -s /path/to/your/FastJet/include/siscone siscone
ln -s /path/to/your/FastJet/include/fastjet fastjet
Build procedures
Once FastJet is properly installed
